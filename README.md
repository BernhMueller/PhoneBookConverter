PhoneBookConverter

 

This program was made to convert your Mac OS phonebook export to an xml file
that your Yealink phone can import and use.

First, inside Mac OS contacts, you have to select all your contacts that you
want to export and then export them using File -\> Export -\> vCard Export

Use this file as input to PhoneBookConverter.

Now start PhoneBookConverter, select your exported phonebook as input and create
a new phonebook xml-file using the „Save as“ dialog.

Put this xml file into the directory of your web server on your Mac and select
it from your YeaLink phone as input under Directory -\> External Phonebook

Enter the URL that points to the converted phonebook.

Now on your phone you will see this phonebook and can import it.
